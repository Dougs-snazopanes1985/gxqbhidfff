OMG, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Bring Her Back and I have sooo many thoughts, like where do I even start? 😩 The ending!! Did not see that coming. Like, seriously, who writes this stuff?! I thought I had the plot all figured out, you know what I mean? But NOPE, they totally flipped the script and I was just there, slack-jawed, thinking wait, what? 😂

So first off, the characters—I mean, half the time I was thinking are these people for real? Like, come on! There were moments where I just wanted to grab them and shake them. But then other parts where I was low-key rooting for them, even the ones I hated at first. It’s like they all graduated with honors from the Hard Knock Life Academy, I swear. 😆

> Did you get a chance to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   yet? It’s definitely one to check off the list, if only just for the mind-blowing twists. At least now we have something to laugh and complain about over coffee. 🎬

BTW, the cinematography! Some scenes were just pure eye candy, like I wish I could step through the screen or at least 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦ze-frame it and hang it on my wall. But then, other scenes looked like they were shot with a potato. 😂 Like, consistency much?? The soundtrack was a whole mood though, 100% made the intense moments hit harder. 🎶

Oh man, and don't even get me started on the dialogue... Some lines were gold, like I want them written in my memoirs or something. But then there were others where I rolled my eyes so hard I thought they'd get stuck. 😑 Like, who talks like that IRL? NOBODY, that’s who.

Yo, sidenote: remember when we wanted to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   together but never got around to it? Def gotta make that happen next time. It’s frustrating and entertaining all rolled into one ridiculous package. So, the perfect   night spectacle if you ask me. 🍿

int main() { return 0; } // Like, why did I even type this?? Lol, ignore me.

Kinda tired now, but I’m weirdly hyped talking about it. Care for a   night this weekend then? I need someone to share all my random thoughts with and you’re just unlucky enough to be my go-to, lol. 😜 Catch you later!
